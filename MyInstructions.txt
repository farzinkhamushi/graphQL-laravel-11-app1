mutation(email:String!,password:String!){
    loginUser(
        input:{
            email:$email
            password:$password
        }
    ){
        success
        message
        user{
            id
            name
            token
        }
    }
}

in the Variable write this code:

{
    "email": "yourentered email in the database that has been registered but not loged in"
    "password":"your desired password"
}



{
    me{
        id
        name
        email
    }
}

in the header you should collect the token (the last one you have requested in login)
Header write these codes :

{
    "Accept":"application\json" you could ignore this i couldn't understand why if yes tell me
    "Authorization":"Bearer the_token"
}
